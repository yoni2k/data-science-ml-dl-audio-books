# Conclusions per execution:
## Conclusions 3 - some starting params - different activation functions
- Train accuracies are around .82%, validate and test around .80% - overfitting
- Training time around 3 seconds for most, 1 model with 7 seconds
- Funcs are different every time. 
    - 4/5 relu first, (other tanh)
    - relu, tanh appears twice in best out of 5
    - All functions appeared at least once 
### Conclusions going forward:
- Need to try with a lot of different params
